For each entry in the interface monitor output:
    If TxnType is Read:
        If last_read_timestamp is not -1:
            read_latency_sum += current_timestamp - last_read_timestamp
            total_reads += 1
        last_read_timestamp = current_timestamp
    Else if TxnType is Write:
        If last_write_timestamp is not -1:
            write_latency_sum += current_timestamp - last_write_timestamp
            total_writes += 1
        last_write_timestamp = current_timestamp
    bandwidth_sum += size_of(Data)
    total_transactions += 1

Calculate average_read_latency = read_latency_sum / total_reads
Calculate average_write_latency = write_latency_sum / total_writes
Calculate average_bandwidth = bandwidth_sum / total_transactions

Recommended RL Algorithm:
An Actor-Critic algorithm would be suitable for this problem statement. Here's why:

Continuous State Space: Actor-Critic methods can handle continuous state spaces efficiently, which is crucial in optimizing network-on-chip parameters where states may vary continuously.
Value and Policy Learning: Actor-Critic combines value-based and policy-based methods. The critic learns the value function, estimating the expected return, while the actor learns the policy directly, suggesting actions based on the current state.
Fine-Tuning Parameters: Actor-Critic methods provide a balance between exploration and exploitation, enabling fine-tuning of network-on-chip parameters to achieve desired performance metrics.
Design Considerations:
Exploration: Implement exploration strategies such as epsilon-greedy or softmax to encourage exploration of the parameter space.
Experience Replay: Use experience replay to improve sample efficiency and stabilize learning.
Neural Network Architecture: Design neural network architectures for both the actor and critic components to efficiently represent the policy and value function, respectively.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, discount factors, and exploration rates to optimize the RL algorithm's performance.
Conclusion:
Based on the problem statement and the nature of the environment, an Actor-Critic algorithm is recommended for training an RL agent to optimize network-on-chip parameters. It strikes a balance between value-based and policy-based methods, allowing for effective parameter tuning while maximizing bandwidth and minimizing latency.
